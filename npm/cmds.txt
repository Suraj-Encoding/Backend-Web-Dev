                      ## npm commands ##

1. npm init   ->  It creates one package.json file
2. ctl + c    ->  To Exit
3. npm install <pkg name>    -> To install third party packages
4. npm uninstall <pkg name>  -> To uninstall installed packages
5. npm install  -> It will install all the dependencies from packege.json file
                   that means it will create node_modules folder again which was deleted
6. npm install <pkg name>@version -> To install the specific version of the package
7. npm uninstall <pkg name>@version -> To uninstall the specific version of the package
   # ( Example: npm install slugify@1.6.4 ) #
8. npm install nodemon --save-dev
     - It will install 'nodemon' locally in the directory
     - and save as a dev-dependency in package.json file
     - ' --save-dev' will make it as dev-dependency
9. npm install nodemon --global  -> installed globally on your machine
10. 'npm i' means 'npm install' -> 'i' stands for install

                           ## Info ##

1. npm -> Node Package Manager
2. package.json file stores the basic information about package.
3. newly install packeges will be store as a dependency in the package.json file.
4. 3 types of files are created: 
       1. package.json  - (when npm init)
       2. package-lock.json  
       3. node_modules folder of installed packages
   # (when npm install next 2 files were created) #

5. If node_modules folder was deleted accidently 
   then use 'npm install' cmd to recover it again.
6. version concept: 
      # Form: (major).(minor).(patch)
      # Example: 1.3.5 
      # Terms Meaning: 
         1. major version - [main version] - Big changes or updates
         2. minor version - Small changes like adding new functions etc.
         3. patch - Bug fixes 
         # (one change - one increament) #
      # The initial version of any software is always ->  (1.0.0)
        as it has no new addition and bug fixes.
      # version cycle:
         1.0.0 - Initial version
         1.0.0 - Having bugs
         1.0.1 - fixes the bugs
         1.1.0 - new features added
         2.0.0 - Very big and major update 
        [......So on the cycle is continue]
      # sign: 
         - There are three types of sign in front of version that are '^', '~' and '>'
         - Suppose we have packege - "slugify": "^1.6.4"
         - First delete your 'node_modules' folder and update your package.json file 
           that is write package with version in your package.json file
         1. [^] -> It will Install exact that version which is mention
            # [^1.6.2] -> It Install version '1.6.2'
         2. [~] -> It will install that version with latest patch
            # [~1.6.2] -> It Install version '1.6.4' which is latest 
         3. [>] -> It will install the latest version of that package - (major updates are also consider)
            # [>1.5.2] -> It Install version '1.6.4' which is latest 
         
7. nodemon -> It restarts the server automatically
8. Now we use 'nodemon' instead of 'node' to run node.js files
   i.e -> 'nodemon file.js'  and not  'node file.js'
9. Important Node.Js keywords:
    1. npm -> Node Package Manager - To install/download packages
    2. npx -> Node Package Execute - To execute packages
    3. nvm -> Node Version Manager - To manage versions of packages
